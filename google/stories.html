          After I moved to New York City from Kazakhstan, I wanted to go back to school. I was grateful that LaGuardia was willing to accept me when every other school turned me down. However, LaGuardia did not just accept me - it gave a chance to develop myself intellectually and professionally. In the very first semester, I met professors who encouraged me to create my own path. I wanted a debate club and with their support, I established “Political Arena” where I presided for a year. Same professors brought to my attention a program called “President’s Society”, where our mentors and professors trained us to be the ambassadors for the college. There I have met many wonderful students, who became my good friends and most importantly my support system.<br><br> Overtime, lessons learned at the President’s Society became opportunities and boosted my confidence significantly. Today, I am a very proud to be a LaGuardian. I am about to graduate with a Journalism degree. I am currently interning at Senator Kirsten Gillibrand’s office as liaison at the Military Affairs department. In addition, I am a New York Needs You Fellow and a member of a Fellows Leadership Council for it – that is a professional development program where we explore opportunities and various careers.<br><br>  LaGuardia did not just open its doors for me; it also gave me an opportunity to explore other prestigious colleges. For example, this summer I spent five weeks living in a first college in the US that was open for women – Vassar College, where I studied in rigorous and challenging classes while exploring whether I can and like living in the dorm environment. Thankfully, to LaGuardia, I know that I want to study in a liberal arts college and I am confident I will be accepted to one upon my graduation.</p>

          My fascination with technology began in my early childhood. After seeing a futuristic watch with incredible capacities in anime, Sailor Moon, I realized that I wanted to be an engineer. When I came to New York City, I realized that this was the place where I could make my dreams come true. I enrolled at LaGuardia Community College and became a member of the Computer Science club. It was the first step that introduced me to the world of technology. <br><br>With the LaGuardia Community College’s help and support I have grown magnificently. LaGuardia gave me a lot of opportunity to develop my personal and professional skills. Two times I received Foundation Scholarship, was awarded Women in STEM and MAA Maxima Tensor-Summa grants, and became a President’s Society ambassador. President’s Society gave me a great opportunity to make a contribution to my college and develop my professional skills. With the faculty’ support I became the first female at LaGuardia who completed the undergraduate research in math, and wrote a paper that was accepted by peer-reviewed journal.<br><br>
          When I took my first class in programming, I had no previous experience. At LaGuardia, I was able to build strong fundamentals and was able to learn other languages on my own. I was very excited to apply my new programming skills. Thus, I developed web surveys and report pages for Math, Engineering, and Computer Science Department to minimize the use of paper and simplify the data analysis. Moreover, I participated in the development of the first LaGuardia application with Phi Theta Kappa. 
          My goal is to earn a master’s degree in Computer Science and become a web/software developer. I am determined to be a female entrepreneur and found my own startup to inspire other women and children to pursue their careers in math and science.</p>

          LaGuardia has changed my life. It provided me the support system I needed as a teenager when I first arrived to NY.It gave me confidence to speak English not only grammar.
          In college I have had the continuing support system which allowed me to fall in love with education.
          LaGuardia also taught me of giving back to the community. There volunteers spend some time with me when I was learning English. They taught me English conversation and writing. After I got in to college I went back to the same program and I taught English to international students because I believe that it helped me so much to make a huge difference in my English. <br><br>
          In my third semester, I became the part of the real LaGuardia family, President's Society where you learn how to push boundaries beyond your limit.
          One of the most important thing I learned was building confidence about yourself and learning about your own capabilities and skills and apply them for benefits.
          I always thought that rich and successful professionals are born the way they are today,
          but I realized along the program that they were born the same way I was born.
          Hard-work, determination, and great mentors are the 3 big factors that have taken them to success.
          <br><br>
          LaGuardia has been the most amazing event that has happened in my life. I am 22 years old now. I have spent 3 years at LaGuardia, and I cannot compare the experience and the knowledge within these 3 years with rest of my life... To me LaGuardia is home...</p>
